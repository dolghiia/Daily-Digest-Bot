About:
Daily Digest Bot is a bot designed using the Reddit API in Python. It is run on
the reddit account u/interestpost-bot. The purpose of this bot is to allow
redditors to get recent top posts from their favourite subreddits. With the
'digest' feature, users can save time scrolling through subreddits by getting
the best posts with just one message to the bot.

Installation Requirements:
-Python 3.8 or later
-praw Module 7.3.0 or later

Features:
-Send hot posts from any public subreddit:
The bot can search the top 25 hottest posts from any public subreddit and choose
at random from the current selection. The user can request up to three posts at
a time from one subreddit, increasing ease of use.
-Create a digest tailored to the user:
The user can add up to five subreddits to their library. With a simple command,
the bot will send back posts from those subreddits. This is ideal for people who
are short on time but still want to see posts from their favourite subreddits.
The user can add one subreddit for all five spaces to get 5 posts from that one
subreddit as well.
